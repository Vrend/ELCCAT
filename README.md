# Endless Legend Cultist Conversion and Teams

A mod for Endless Legend

## Features

1. Enables the ability to play in teams
2. Adds a buff to cultists, allowing them to control regions

Both of these options can be enabled in the advanced settings of game setup

## Cultist Conversion

The cultist buff works by allowing cultists to own regions where they have converted every single village in a region, and there isn't a city. This allows cultists to project power, hold territory, and protect villages.


## Teams

Teams are done by color. When teams are enabled in game setup, players can choose the same color, and if they're the same color they're on the same team and are in an unbreakable alliance.

## Install

This mod edits the dlls of the game, so you have to replace `Assembly-CSharp.dll`
in the install directory

Then drag and drop the `Public` folder into the Endless Legend install directory

## Backup

A backup folder is included in each OS folder, which holds the original unmodified version of `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and original XML files. This is an alternative to 'verify game cache' in Steam.
